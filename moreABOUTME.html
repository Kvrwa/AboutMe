                    Mustang, Nepal is a very remote region in Nepal, for most people living there
                    their daily lives including farming in the little spots they have, and try to
                    make as much money as they can from the little tourists that they get. My family had travelled
                    all the way from there and have made a living, had 2 children (My sister and I), and are living
                    the American working class dream <span style="font-style: italic;">*Sarcasm*</span>.

                    I am now in my Junior year of my undergraduate degree with a brief idea of just what I am interested in.
                    I want to have a future in tech, while also having a future in finance. Which essentially means that I want
                    to be invovled in fintech.
